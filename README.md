## Welcome to my website!
This is a neat little web experiment, making a website that exists in 3 dimensions rather than 2. It uses React (Three.js) and WebGL to make a cool blend of 2D web design (regular stuff like buttons, divs) and 3D space design (moving your viewpoint, clicking on objects instead of buttons).
It is under construction right now but feel free to have a look around. Thanks for stopping by!
